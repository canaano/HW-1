There are two types of Challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

### Challenge Types

The two types of Challenges are the following:

- **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** give you starter code in a folder called `Develop`, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.

- **Job-seeking coding assessments** or **take-home assignments** don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.
